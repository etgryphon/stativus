# Stativus: Statecharts for the Rest of Us!

`Stativus` is a micro-framework that has full functionality of Statecharts for your application.  It can work in any library such as:

  + [`backbone.js`](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
  + [`EmberJS`](http://emberjs.com/)
  + [`spine.js`](http://maccman.github.com/spine/)
  + [ExtJS/Sencha](http://www.sencha.com/)
  + or any others

Statecharts are a great way to organize your web application and make it more robust and increase code reuse.

## Versions

`Stativus` comes in two versions:

  + **Debug Mode**: This is the file named `stativus.js` and it is more readable and you get the following
    + All `enterState` are documented with 'ENTER: *state_name*' 
    + All `exitState` are documented with 'EXIT: *state_name*
    + All events are documented with 'EVENT: *state_name* fired [*event_name*] with *n* argument(s)'
    + Any time your application is configured in such a way that it will break, you will get a console or exception
    + All Async starts and stops will be outputted to the console.
    + Will warn you if you forgot to return true when using willEnterState()
  + **Minified**: this is the file named `stativus-min.js` and is a minified version for production use (gzipped: <3k)

## Demo
A list of all demos can be found at [Stativus Demos](http://demo.stativ.us)
